- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @karanchilwal
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in deep learning algorithms specially CNN based architectures.
- ğŸŒ± I have completed a major project as my masters thesis in which Unet Autoencoder based model is prepared for the prediction of pressure contours around an oscillating airfoil.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer vision algorithms such object detection, semantic segmentation, etc.
- ğŸ“« I could be contacted via my Linked Profile : https://www.linkedin.com/in/karan-chilwal-5b2ab7113/
- I have updated partial files of my project work here, will upload soon. #new_to_github
